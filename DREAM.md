# DREAM.md — memory consolidation

"Dreaming" is the maintenance pass that keeps the KB compact and retrievable —
the agent equivalent of sleep consolidating the day's memories. Run it manually,
on a `/loop`, or whenever the KB feels noisy (duplicates, sprawl, stale facts).

## When to dream

- The index `MEMORY.md` has grown large or has near-duplicate lines.
- Several notes restate the same fact, or one note has grown into many facts.
- A note contradicts newer knowledge, or its `updated:` is old and may be stale.
- A note is orphaned (no `[[links]]`), or links/tags have sprawled.
- Links `[[slug]]` point at notes that don't exist (or should).
- New unprocessed files sit in `raw/`.
- On a schedule, e.g. `/loop 1d "run ~/kb/DREAM.md consolidation"`.

## The pass

1. **Load.** Read `MEMORY.md`, then every `memory/*.md`. Read `.agent/state.json`.
2. **Ingest raw.** For any file in `raw/` not in `state.json.processed`, synthesize
   its facts into notes (per `AGENTS.md` §2) and record it in `processed`.
3. **Dedupe & merge.** Fold duplicate/overlapping notes into one. Keep the
   clearest, most recent phrasing. Lossless of meaning, not of words.
4. **Split.** If a note holds multiple facts, split into atomic notes.
5. **Validate frontmatter.** Every note has top-level `name` (== filename stem),
   `description`, `type`, `tags`, `created`, `updated`. Fix the `<type>-` filename
   prefix if `type` changed. No nested `metadata:` blocks.
6. **Refresh from sources.** For notes with a `sources:` URL whose `updated:` is
   stale (>~30 days) or whose facts look outdated, fetch the source (prefer
   `llms.txt`), update the note, and bump `updated:`.
7. **Compact.** Trim notes to the essential facts. Drop filler. Aim ≤~25 lines.
8. **Relink & retag.** Fix `[[slug]]` references; ensure no orphans (every note
   links ≥1 other); merge tag sprawl into the controlled vocabulary; drop links
   to deleted notes.
9. **Prune.** Delete notes that are wrong, obsolete, or now-private — and their
   index lines.
10. **Rebuild index.** Regenerate `MEMORY.md` from surviving notes — grouped by
    `type`, one line each: `[Title](file) — hook`.
11. **Verify scope.** Confirm no secrets/hosts/confidential facts slipped in
    (`AGENTS.md` §3). Remove any that did.
12. **Stamp & sync.** Set `state.json.last_dream` to today, then `~/kb/scripts/sync.sh`.

## Principles

- **Lossless of meaning.** Compaction removes words and redundancy, never facts.
- **Atomic.** One fact per file after the pass.
- **Retrieval-first.** Every `description` must let an agent judge relevance from
  the index alone; every note is reachable via tags and `[[links]]`.
- **Conservative deletes.** Only prune what is wrong, redundant, or out-of-scope —
  never delete a fact just because it's old (refresh it instead, step 6).
- **Idempotent.** Running the pass twice in a row should change nothing the
  second time.
